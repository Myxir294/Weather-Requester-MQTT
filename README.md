# Weather Requester via MQTT

Simple command line app downloading weather data from the web server and publishing it further via MQTT.<br />
Can be run in Docker image using docker compose command.<br />

Made using Github Codespaces tool. <br />



The code written by me is located in "Weather Requester" folder (main is the "script.py").
Other files are residues of the template repository and are likely to be deleted in the future for the sake of clarity.
