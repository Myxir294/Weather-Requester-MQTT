There are no specific skills needed for this tutorial beyond a basic comfort with the command line and using a text editor. This tutorial uses `git clone` to clone the repository locally. If you don't have Git installed on your system, either install it or remember to manually download the zip files from Github. Prior experience in developing web applications will be helpful but is not required. As we proceed further along the tutorial, we'll make use of a few cloud services.
