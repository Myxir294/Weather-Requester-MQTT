title: Getting Started
---

This document contains a series of several sections, each of which explains a particular aspect of Docker. In each section, we will be typing commands (or writing code). All the code used in the tutorial is available in the [Github repo](http://github.com/prakhar1989/docker-curriculum).

> Note: This tutorial uses version **18.05.0-ce** of Docker. If you find any part of the tutorial incompatible with a future version, please raise an [issue](https://github.com/prakhar1989/docker-curriculum/issues). Thanks!
