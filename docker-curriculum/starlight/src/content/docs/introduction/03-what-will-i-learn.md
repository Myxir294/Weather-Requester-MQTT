title: What will this tutorial teach me?
---

This tutorial aims to be the one-stop shop for getting your hands dirty with Docker. Apart from demystifying the Docker landscape, it'll give you hands-on experience with building and deploying your own webapps on the Cloud. We'll be using [Amazon Web Services](http://aws.amazon.com) to deploy a static website, and two dynamic webapps on [EC2](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/) using [Elastic Beanstalk](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/) and [Elastic Container Service](https://aws.amazon.com/ecs/). Even if you have no prior experience with deployments, this tutorial should be all you need to get started.
